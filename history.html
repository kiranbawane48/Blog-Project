        <h2>1.OUR HISTORY</h2>
        <p></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers
        to modern tools
        for software development. Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical
        notation and similarly obscure syntax.[1] Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory led to
        the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate
        instructions.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The first high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945.[2]
            The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in 1951, for his
            PhD thesis.[3] The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in
            1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at IBM.

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            During 1842–1849, Ada Lovelace translated the memoir of Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea about Charles
            Babbage's newest proposed machine: the Analytical Engine; she supplemented the memoir with notes that
            specified in detail a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the engine, recognized by most of
            historians as the world's first published computer program.[4]
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The first computer codes were specialized for their applications: e.g., Alonzo Church was able to express
            the lambda calculus in a formulaic way and the Turing machine was an abstraction of the operation of a
            tape-marking machine.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Jacquard Looms and Charles Babbage's Difference Engine both had simple languages[citation needed] for
        describing the actions that these machines should perform hence they were the creators of the first
        programming language.
